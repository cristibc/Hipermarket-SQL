## Overview
![Screenshot of the program](/Docs/screen1.png "Screenshot")

## Project Description

I have created a database that can be used by a hypermarket chain to manage
orders placed there by customers. Specific data can be entered into it
about products, such as their categories and suppliers, the employees working in the different
stores and customers who frequent the hypermarkets.

## Features 

- The database is valid in terms of ER integrity
- The interface is made in PHP + MySQL
- CRUD interface with responsive tables (sort, sort, search, add, delete functions, etc.)
- Relational schemas and constraints checked by the interface with correct display of errors
